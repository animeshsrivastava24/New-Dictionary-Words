What is NLP?
Natural language processing (NLP) is a subfield of linguistics, computer science, and artificial intelligence concerned with the interactions between computers and human language, in particular how to program computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data. Challenges in natural language processing frequently involve speech recognition, natural language understanding, and natural-language generation.

Sometimes NLP is also refered for Neuro-linguistic programming. Neuro-linguistic programming (NLP) is a pseudoscientific approach to communication, personal development, and psychotherapy. It is not related with machine learning.
